# Website Milestone 3

## Searching and Filtering
For this milestone you will modifying your filtering approach to use LINQ, and adding some additional features to your website.

Beyond these core requirements, you may add features and elements as you see fit.  Moreover, you are encouraged to style the site using CSS.

### General Requirements

You will need to follow the style laid out in the [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).

Each new class should be declared in the **CowboyCafe.Website** or **CowboyCafe.Data** namespace, depending on the project it belongs to.

### Jerked Soda Flavors

Display a list of all the available jerked soda flavors near the list of drinks.  The exact placement is up to you.

### Responsive Design

Use [CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to make your menu responsive - on screens wider than 490 pixels, you should display the menu as three columns, but on screens smaller than that (i.e. phones), display them as a single column.

### Search and Filter Functionality

Refactor your searching and filtering function to use [LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/) instead.

You will likely want to use the [where](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/filtering-data) clause.
