# Documenting Objects
While often overlooked, *documenting* is a critically important part of writing software.  There are two purposes to documenting:

1. To explain to end users how the software should be used, and
2. To explain to developers how the software works.

For the moment, we'll focus on the second use for documentation - documentation intended for developers.  In the early days of programming, this would often be done in a separate file or files from the source code, due to memory limitations.  But today we often employ in-code documentation, along with powerful tools that make it even more useful.

## .NET XML Documentation
Consider the .NET XML Documentation - a collection of XML tags and commenting styles that Visual Studio will find and use for Intellisense (the tooltips that pop up as you code in Visual Studio, explaining what a class is and how it is to be used).  

Let's revisit our **Vector3** class and employ this documentation approach:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// A class representing a 3-element vector using doubles.
/// </summary>
public class Vector3 {

  /// <summary>
  /// Gets or sets the X property
  /// </summary>
  public double X;

  /// <summary>
  /// Gets or sets the Y property
  /// </summary>
  public double Y;

  /// <summary>
  /// Gets or sets the Z property
  /// </summary>
  public double Z;

  /// <summary>
  /// Constructs a new instance of Vector3 with
  /// X, Y, and Z properties set to 0.
  /// </summary>
  public Vector3() {
    this.X = 0;
    this.Y = 0;
    this.Z = 0;
  }

  /// <summary>
  /// Constructs a new instance of Vector3 with
  /// the supplied values for X, Y, and Z.
  /// <param name="X">A double precision number for the x component of the vector.</param>
  /// <param name="Y">A double precision number for the y component of the vector.</param>
  /// <param name="Z">A double precision number for the z component of the vector.</param>
  /// </summary>
  public Vector3(double x, double y, double z) {
    this.X = x;
    this.Y = y;
    this.Z = z;
  }
}
```

Using the .NET XML documentation format makes your documentation consistent with that of other developers, and therefore easier to read.  However, this is not its only benefit.  As discussed earlier, it can be used to supply Intellisense details in Visual Studio.

## Generating the Documentation XML File
To get us to that point, we must first generate an XML file (hence the name .NET XML documentation) from the comments.  Visual Studio can do this for us, we just need to tell it to do so.

### Step 1 - Open the Solution Properties Page
You can open the solution properties page by choosing **"<Solution Name> Properties"** from the **Solution** menu, or by selecting **"properties"** from the context menu after right-clicking on your solution in the solution explorer.

### Step 2 - Enable XML File Creation
In the solution properties page, select the **build** tab.  Then check the **"XML documentation file"** checkbox.

![Properties Build Tab]({{site.baseurl}}/img/xml-doc-properties.png)

This will cause the project to create an XML file from the inline comments as part of the build process.  For the above code, it will look like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<doc>
    <assembly>
        <name>VectorMath</name>
    </assembly>
    <members>
        <member name="T:VectorMath.Vector3">
            <summary>
            A class representing a 3-element vector using doubles.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:VectorMath.Vector3.X">
            <summary>
            Gets or sets the X property
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:VectorMath.Vector3.Y">
            <summary>
            Gets or sets the Y property
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:VectorMath.Vector3.Z">
            <summary>
            Gets or sets the Z property
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:VectorMath.Vector3.#ctor">
            <summary>
            Constructs a new instance of Vector3 with
            X, Y, and Z properties set to 0.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="M:VectorMath.Vector3.#ctor(System.Double,System.Double,System.Double)">
            <summary>
            Constructs a new instance of Vector3 with
            the supplied values for X, Y, and Z.
            <param name="X">A double precision number for the x component of the vector.</param>
            <param name="Y">A double precision number for the y component of the vector.</param>
            <param name="Z">A double precision number for the z component of the vector.</param>
            </summary>
        </member>
    </members>
</doc>
```

### Step 3 - Reference the Library from Another Project

If we were to build the project, it creates both the XML file and a DLL file (assuming the project type is a library).  The DLL file will be located in the **bin/** folder (short for binary).

We can then include the resulting DLL in another project by right-clicking on the **"Dependencies"** in the Solution Explorer and selecting **"Add Reference"** from the context menu.  Then click the "browse" button and find your DLL file in the filesystem to reference it.

When we do, our documentation will appear within Intellisense tooltips.

We can also use the XML file to autogenerate html documentation using tools like [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/).
