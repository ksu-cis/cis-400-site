# Chapter 3 - Modeling Classes and their Relationships

Now that we have a firm grasp of what classes and objects are, it's time to turn our attention to how we use multiple objects _together_.  After all, a program consisting of a single class isn't going to be able to accomplish much.

In fact, we've already examined one kind of relationship between classes - that of inheritance.  But this is only one approach to combining objects.  In this chapter, we'll look at other kinds of associations, as well as how to model them using _unified modeling language_, aka _UML_.


## Key Terms

Some key terms to learn in this chapter are:

* Unified Modeling Language (UML)
* Association
* Generalization
* Realization
* Composition
* Aggregation

## Working with UML Class Diagrams

In addition, you'll want to get familiar with UML Class Diagrams - and be able to both implement a class (write the code) from looking at a class diagram, and draw a class diagram from looking at an implementation (existing code).
